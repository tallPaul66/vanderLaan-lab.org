Together with Judea Pearl, Jasjeet Sekhon, and Maya Petersen, I am pleased to announce the launch of the Journal of Causal Inference - a new journal that publishes papers on theoretical and applied causal research across the range of academic disciplines that use quantitative tools to study causality. Our first issue is planned for Fall 2011 and our website is now open for submissions.

Together with Alan Hubbard, Michael Jordan, and Rasmus Nielsen, I am leading the NIH-funded [Biomedical Big Data Training Program at UC Berkeley](http://bbd.berkeley.edu/). The program responds to the urgent need for advances in data science so that the next generation of scientists has the necessary skills for leveraging the unprecedented and ever-increasing quantity and speed of biomedical information. 

----------------

I am the PI for the new [Berkeley's Center for Targeted Machine Learning and Causal Inference](link), which develops, implements and disseminates signature methods for exploiting vast, new health datasets.

Targeted learning methods are critical tools within data science for answering complex statistical questions, including estimands in networks and longitudinal data with time-dependent confounding. We present a scientific roadmap to translate real-world data science applications into formal statistical estimation problems. This is accomplished using the general template of targeted maximum likelihood estimators to construct algorithms that incorporate the state-of-the-art in machine learning for estimation, while still providing valid inference. Standard tools are not currently equipped for these challenges. We include demonstrations with software packages and real data sets, as well as new methodological advances since the publication of [the first targeted learning book](http://www.targetedlearningbook.com/).
