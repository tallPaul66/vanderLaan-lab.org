title: Projects on Multiple Hypothesis Testing
---

Multiple testing methods are hypothesis testing procedures designed to simultaneously test a family of null hypotheses while controlling an error rate. We have described a general statistical framework for multiple hypothesis testing, in which we define error rate control in terms of the true underlying data generating distribution. We have shown that the correct null distribution for the test statistics is obtained by projecting their true distribution onto the space of mean zero distributions. For common choices of test statistics (based on an asymptotically linear parameter estimator), this distribution is asymptotically multivariate normal with mean zero and the covariance of the vector influence curve for the parameter estimator.

This test statistic null distribution can be estimated by applying the non-parametric or parametric bootstrap to correctly centered test statistics. We have proven that this bootstrap estimated null distribution provides asymptotic strong control of most type I error rates. We have shown that obtaining a test statistic null distribution from a data null distribution only provides the correct test statistic null distribution if the covariance of the vector influence curve is the same under the data null distribution as under the true data distribution. This condition is the formal analogue of the subset pivotality condition (Westfall and Young, 1993). We have also shown that our multiple testing methodology controlling type I error is equivalent to constructing an error-specific confidence region for the true parameter values and checking if it contains the hypothesized value.

In recent years, there has been increased interest in the field of multiple testing due to new technologies, such as gene expression arrays, that produce data for which (i) the dimension is much larger than the sample size, (ii) the variables (e.g.: genes) are often correlated, and (iii) some proportion of the null hypotheses is expected to be true. Gene expression studies have motivated us to better understand error control in multiple hypothesis testing, though our results apply to multiple testing in general.
