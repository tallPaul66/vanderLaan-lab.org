Targeted learning methods are critical tools within data science for answering complex statistical questions, including estimands in networks and longitudinal data with time-dependent confounding. We present a scientific roadmap to translate real-world data science applications into formal statistical estimation problems. This is accomplished using the general template of targeted maximum likelihood estimators to construct algorithms that incorporate the state-of-the-art in machine learning for estimation, while still providing valid inference. Standard tools are not currently equipped for these challenges. We include demonstrations with software packages and real data sets, as well as new methodological advances since the publication of [the first targeted learning book](http://www.targetedlearningbook.com/).
