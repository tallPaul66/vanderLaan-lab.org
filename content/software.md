The van der Laan group contributes state-of-the-art software for Targeted
Learning over a wide range of platforms, primarily using the [R language for
statistical computing](https://www.r-project.org/) but also occasionally in
programming languages such as Python, Julia, SAS, C++, and Java.

[The TLverse](https://github.com/tlverse) is a centralized effort to overhaul
the Targeted Learning software ecosystem in R. For a more general set of
open-source software packages, consider checking out the [UC Berkeley
Biostatistics Software Community](http://berkeleybiostats.github.io/).

The van der Laan Group GitHub organization is accessible
[here](https://github.com/vanderLaan-Group).

Software contributions are also routinely available on the GitHub profiles of
individual students.
