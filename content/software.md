The van der Laan group contributes state-of-the-art software for Targeted
Learning over a wide range of platforms, based on computing languages such as
R, Python, Julia, SAS, C++, and Java.

[UC Berkeley Biostats Software Community](http://berkeleybiostats.github.io/)
serves as a central portal for access to all open-source softwares created by
the group.
